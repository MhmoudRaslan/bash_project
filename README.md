# Bash Shell Script Database Management System (DBMS)

## Project Overview
This project is a simple **Database Management System (DBMS)** built entirely using **Bash shell scripting**. 
It simulates database operations using **directories and files** instead of a real database engine. 
The goal is to understand how DBMS features work internally while practicing shell scripting.
